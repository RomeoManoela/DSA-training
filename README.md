This repository contains my daily practice and learning progress in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).  
Each folder represents a specific topic I worked on.

## Structure
- `BST` - Binary Search Trees
- `DoublyLinkedList` - Doubly Linked List exercises
- `Graph` - Graph algorithms
- `HashTable` - Hash table implementations
- `LinkedList` - Single Linked List problems
- `Recursion` - Recursion exercises
- `Stack && Queue` - Stack and Queue problems

## Purpose
The goal is to strengthen my understanding of DSA through daily problem-solving.

## Language
- Python 100%

Feel free to explore and learn along!
